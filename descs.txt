AdLiPo (2014) is a browser plugin that replaces advertisements with
generated language art. Leveraging the ad-detection
techniques of popular Ad-blocking software, AdLiPo not only blocks Ads,
but replaces their content with calls to a Javascript language library (e.g. the RiTa library), filling the Ad space with static or kinetic text created for the
context (based on the containing web-page, advertising-content, and
dimensions of the Ad). 
<br> <br>
For the experimental writer, the AdLiPo framework presents a unique set of spatial and thematic 
constraints for writing across the face of the browser, arguably the most
ubiquitous interface of our time. The debut installation
presents one realization of the AdLiPo framework, composed by the
author, but also demonstrates (and documents) its potential as a system
for other language artists to use in their own work.

In the version you see at the ELC, AdLiPo uses a Markov model in RiTa to generate the txts for its Ad replacements. The model is composed of the 'description' texts from partipicants in the conference, sprinkled liberally with quotations from Marx and the MArquis de Sade. If you look carefully (and refresh a few times on an amenable page like the New York Times), you're likely to see bits of your own description amidst the Ad copy.
